There For You,480426313,"I woke up pissed off today.And lately, everyone feels fake.Somewhere, I lost a piece of me.Smoking cigarettes on balconies.But I can't do this alone.Sometimes I just need a light.If I call you on the phone.Need you on the other side.So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river.I'll be there for you.I'll be there for you.When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper.I'll be loud for you.But you gotta be there for me too.But you gotta be there for me too.Last year took a toll on me.But I made it with you next to me.Around the world and back again.I hope you're waiting at the end.But I can't do this alone.Sometimes I just need a light.If I call you on the phone.Need you on the other side.So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river.I'll be there for you.I'll be there for you.When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper.I'll be loud for you.I'll be loud for you.I got you, I promise.Let me be honest.Love is a road that goes both ways.When your tears roll down your pillow like a river.I'll be there for you.But you gotta be there for me too.But you gotta be there for me too.Boy, I'm holding on to something.Won't let go of you for nothing.I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you.There was a time that I was so blue.What I got to do to show you.I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you.Running, running, just to keep my hands on you.Running, running, just to keep my hands on you.So I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you.But you gotta be there for me too.But you gotta be there for me too."
for him.,37955044,"We are runnin' so fast.And we never look back.And whatever I lack, you make up.We make a really good team.And though not everyone sees.We got this crazy chemistry.Between us.Jump starting your car cause this city's a bore.Buying e-cigarettes at the convenience store.Making new clichés on our own little tour.Let's ride.You don't have to say I love you to say I love you.Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons.We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue.Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money.All I need is you.All I need is you.We try staying up late.But we both are light weights.Yeah we get off our face, too easy.And we take jokes way too far.And sometimes living's too hard.We're like two halves of one heart.You don't have to say I love you to say I love you.Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons.We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue.Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money.All I need is you.All I need is you.AllDay:.Eat a pill stay and chill you don't needa go.I'm about to bring emo back if you leave my home.I'd panic at the disco and you'd rather watch a tv show.Then ill squeeze your booty real hard like I'm kneading dough.Pizza boy, I'm speeding for ya.We canna get married tonight if you really wanna.Me in a cheap suit like a sleazy lawyer.And if you break my lil heart, it’d be an honour.You don't have to say I love you to say I love you.Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons.We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue.Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money.All I need is you.All I need is you."
YOUTH,36668810,"What if, what if we run away?.What if, what if we left today?.What if we said goodbye to safe and sound?.And what if, what if we're hard to find?.What if, what if we lost our minds?.What if we let them fall behind and they're never found?.And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth.And the stars exploding, we’ll be fireproof.My youth, my youth is yours.Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls.My youth, my youth is yours.Run away now and forevermore.My youth, my youth is yours.A truth so loud you can't ignore.My youth, my youth, my youth.My youth is yours.What if, what if we start to drive?.What if, what if we close our eyes?.What if we're speeding through red lights into paradise?.Cause we've no time for getting old.Mortal body; timeless souls.Cross your fingers, here we go.And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth.And the stars exploding, we’ll be fireproof.My youth, my youth is yours.Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls.My youth, my youth is yours.Run away now and forevermore.My youth, my youth is yours.A truth so loud you can't ignore.My youth, my youth, my youth.My youth is yours.My youth is yours.My youth, my youth is yours.Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls.My youth, my youth is yours.Run away now and forevermore.My youth, my youth is yours.A truth so loud you can’t ignore.My youth, my youth, my youth.My youth is yours.My youth is yours.My youth is yours."
Strawberries &amp; Cigarettes,544247584,"Remember when we first met?.You said “light my cigarette”.So I lied to my mom and dad.And jumped the fence and I ran.But we couldn’t go very far.‘Cause you locked your keys in your car.So you sat and stared at my lips.And I could already feel your kiss.Long nights, daydreams.Sugar and smoke rings, I’ve been a fool.But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you.Headlights, on me.Racing to 60, I’ve been a fool.But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like.Blue eyes, black jeans.Lighters and candy, I’ve been a fool.But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you.Remember when you taught me fate.Said it all be worth the wait.Like that night in the back of the cab.When your fingers walked in my hand.Next day, nothing on my phone.But I can still smell you on my clothes.I was hoping that things would change.But we went right back to your games.Long nights, daydreams.Sugar and smoke rings, I’ve been a fool.But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you.Headlights, on me.Racing to 60, I’ve been a fool.But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like.Blue eyes, black jeans.Lighters and candy, I’ve been a fool.But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you.And even if I run away.And give my heart a holiday.Still strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you.You always leave me wanting more.I can’t shake my hunger for.Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you.Yeah, they always taste like you.You.Long nights, daydreams.With that sugar and smoke rings.Always taste like you.Headlights, on me (And even if I run away).Racing to 60, I’ve been a fool (And give my heart a holiday).Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like.Blue eyes, black jeans (You always leave me wanting more).Lighters and candy, I’ve been a fool (I can’t shake my hunger for).Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you."
